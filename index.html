    <p>In life writing paragraphs like this are my least favourite things to write. I could talk about many things for hours, like how The Other Boleyn is the worst representation of The Tudors on TV, and the importance of Mistress to the French court in the 1700’s. But talking about myself? That is something I am not very good at. And I have found myself writing these a lot since coming back to school. But if you ask me to write about myself I shall. I was born in Lower Hutt Hospital on the 7th of November 2010, which was a generally cool day, with clouds, well not that I can remember. Over the next seven years my parents had two more children both boys, in 2013 and 2017 specifically. The "downfall" of my life began in Year Three, and over the next couple of years everything came to light. I was diagnosed with three things: ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder), ADP (Auditory Processing Disorder), and Stomach Migraines (that doesn’t get a fancy acronym, or a nice name) and then later with Anxiety. These four things can make life very hard, but with modern day medicine AKA Pills, Psychology and Therapy or as I like to call it the PPT it makes life easier. History to me is what AI is to my dad, very fascinating. My specific interests in the broad term of History are: The world's Monarchies (even more specifically English (/ British), French and the Ottoman Empire)  Court Structure And Hierarchy and the Impact of Wars And Conflict. Though I do dabble in other stuff here and there, like my recent dive into the history of animals and people (plantology and anthropology) which is very interesting. Baking is also a pastime I like to dabble in, I also like watching The Great British Bake Off, and laughing when they fail in the act of bread making.  Like history, dislike is a very broad word, there are many things I dislike people who cut into lines at the grocery store, or people who yell at children when they themself are acting like the child. But there are certain things in life that I hate, hate with a capital H. Like those stuffed animals with electronic things inside that say something when you squeeze it, weird, creepy, throw it over Hukufalls. Or when you are on an airplane and the person in front of you puts their seat down so far it feels like your legs can't breathe.   </p>
